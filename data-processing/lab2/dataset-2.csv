Christian,"It's so unusual, it's frightening  You see right through the mess inside me  And you call me out to pull me in  You tell me I can start again  And I don't need to keep on hiding  I'm fully known and loved by You  You won't let go no matter what I do  And it's not one or the other  It's hard truth and ridiculous grace  To be known fully known and loved by You  I'm fully known and loved by You  It's so like You to keep pursuing  It's so like me to go astray  But You guard my heart with Your truth  A kind of love that's bulletproof  And I surrender to Your kindness, ooh  I'm fully known and loved by You  You won't let go no matter what I do  And it's not one or the other  It's hard truth and ridiculous grace  To be known fully known and loved by You  I'm fully known and loved by You  How real, how wide  How rich, how high is Your heart  I cannot find the reasons why  You give me so much  How real, how wide  How rich, how high is Your heart  I cannot find the reasons why  You give me so much  I'm fully known and loved by You  You won't let go no matter what I do  And it's not one or the other  It's hard truth and ridiculous grace  To be known fully known and loved by You  I'm fully known and loved by You  It's so unusual, it's frightening  I'm fully known and loved by You","I hate python"
Country,"We've been burnin' both ends Keepin' the lights on So I've been thinkin' we need A little time alone So whatcha say we cancel our plans? Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man Let's get some candles burnin' And some records turnin' All the lights down low Take it nice and slow The way your body's movin' Keep doin' what you're doin' To me all night long Writin' our love song Girl, I want it, gotta have it Let the passion take us to a higher place Makin' the kind of love we make Well, there ain't no way, baby To get me out this house When you look this good What could I even think about? Oh Besides turnin' round and lockin' the door Watchin' your red dress fall to the floor Let's get some candles burnin' And some records turnin' All the lights down low Take it nice and slow The way your body's movin' Keep doin' what you're doin' To me all night long Writin' our love song Girl, I want it, gotta have it Let the passion take us to a higher place Makin' the kind of love we make Kind of love we make So whatcha say we cancel our plans? Tonight, I'm only gonna be your man Let's get some candles burnin' Some records turnin' All the lights down low Take it nice and slow The way your body's movin' Keep doin' what you're doin' To me all night long Writin' our love song Girl, I want it, gotta have it Let the passion take us to a higher place Girl, I want it, gotta have it Let the passion take us to a higher place Makin' the kind of love we make Kind of love we make Makin' the kind of love we make","I hate python"
